        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI chose to make a website about Linux because I've been learning about it a lot as an Information Technology major. We did an installation in one of my classes and the professor sings praises of linux but many of my classmates don't seem to care about it at all. However I joined the CyberSecurity Club and I've seen Graduate students and alumni use linux for hacking drills. I also see Linux projects on Reddit such as drones and Electronic Skateboards, so my interest has been piqued. </p>
